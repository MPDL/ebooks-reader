# ebooks-reader
## Description
This project is an eBooks reader for the eBook resources within Max Planck Society's intranet. Currently, we provide accesses to 3 collections
on https://ebooks.mpdl.mpg.de/ebooks/, which are "Springer eBooks 2005-", "Springer BookArchives -2004" and "OAPEN", respectively.

It is worth mentioning that this project is based on the open-source project MuPDF(see the source link on https://mupdf.com/), which is a very good base PDF reader.
